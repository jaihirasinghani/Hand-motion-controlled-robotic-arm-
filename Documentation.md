# Project Documentation

# 1. Introduction
This project is a Robotic Arm Control System that utilizes an Arduino,
MPU6050 gyroscope/accelerometer, and a flex sensor to interpret hand gestures for controlling a robotic arm. 
The system translates hand orientation into arm movements (forward/reverse, up/down, left/right) and uses finger bending detected by a flex sensor to control the gripper.

Connection Guide

MPU6050: Connect SDA to A4, SCL to A5, VCC to 3.3V, and GND to GND on the Arduino.

Flex Sensor: Connect one end to 5V and the other end to a voltage divider setup that reads the output on an analog pin (e.g., A0).
# 4 Servo Motors
Servo Motors:
Servo 1 (Forward/Reverse): Pin 3
Servo 2 (Up/Down): Pin 5
Servo 3 (Gripper): Pin 6
Servo 4 (Left/Right): Pin 9

Power Supply: Ensure a stable power supply for the servo motors, typically an external 5V power source.


# 5. Software Setup
Arduino IDE Installation

1. Download the Arduino IDE from the official website.

2. Install the IDE by following the on-screen instructions.

# Library Installation
Open the Arduino IDE.
Go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries.
Search for and install the Wire, Servo, and MPU6050 libraries.
Uploading the Code
1. Connect your Arduino board to the computer via USB.
2. Open the provided sketch file in the Arduino IDE.
3. Select the correct board and port under Tools.
4. Click the Upload button to transfer the code to the Arduino.

# 6. Code Explanation
The Arduino sketch is divided into several sections:

Initialization: Sets up the MPU6050 sensor and servo motors.
Data Reading: Continuously reads data from the MPU6050 and flex sensor.
Data Processing: Converts raw sensor data into angles and movements.
Servo Control: Maps the processed data to control the servo motors.
Key lines and functions are commented in the code for clarity.

# 7. Working Principle
MPU6050: Captures the orientation and movement of the hand. The sensor provides data on the X, Y, and Z axes, which is processed to control the arm’s direction.
Flex Sensor: Detects the bending of the fingers. When the flex sensor reaches a specific threshold, it commands the gripper to open or close.

# 8. Calibration
To calibrate the MPU6050, adjust the minimum and maximum values for the X, Y, and Z axes in the code.
Test and fine-tune the servo positions for optimal movement range and accuracy.

# 9. Troubleshooting
Common Issues
Incorrect Sensor Readings: Ensure the MPU6050 is properly connected and powered. Check for loose wires.
Servo Motor Not Moving: Verify the power supply and correct pin assignments in the code.
Flex Sensor Not Responding: Check the voltage divider setup and connections to the analog pin.

Solutions
Use a multimeter to check connections and power supply.
Re-upload the code and ensure all libraries are correctly installed.

# 10. Testing
Initial Setup: Test each component individually to ensure they are working properly.
System Test: After integrating all components, test the full system by performing different gestures and observing the robotic arm’s response.
Adjustments: Make any necessary adjustments to the code or hardware connections based on the test results.

# 11. Performance Analysis
Accuracy: Measure the accuracy of the arm’s movements in response to gestures.
Response Time: Evaluate how quickly the system responds to hand gestures.
Durability: Test the system over extended periods to assess its reliability and stability.
