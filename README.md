# Robotic Arm Control System Using MPU6050 and Flex Sensor

This repository contains the code, circuit diagram, and reference screenshots for a Robotic Arm Control System built using an Arduino, MPU6050 gyroscope/accelerometer, and a flex sensor. This system allows for intuitive, real-time control of a robotic arm by interpreting hand gestures, providing an engaging way to interface with robotic hardware.

Overview
The project leverages the capabilities of the MPU6050 sensor to capture the orientation and motion of the hand, translating these into movements of a robotic arm. A flex sensor is used to detect finger bending, which controls the gripper's open and close actions.

Key Features:
Gesture-Based Control: The system interprets hand orientation and motion to drive the arm's forward/reverse, up/down, and left/right movements.

Gripper Functionality: The flex sensor controls the gripper, simulating a hand's grasping and releasing actions.

Real-Time Responsiveness: The system provides near-instantaneous feedback, making the robotic arm's movement smooth and precise.

Customizable: The code is modular, allowing for easy adjustments and expansions, such as adding more sensors or modifying the control logic.


Repository Contents
Code/: Contains the Arduino sketch that interfaces with the MPU6050 and flex sensor, and controls the servo motors.

Circuit Diagram/: Detailed schematics illustrating the connections between all hardware components.

Screenshots/: Reference images showing the physical setup and operational snapshots for better understanding and replication.

README.md: Comprehensive guide on the project, including setup, usage, and customization instructions.


Hardware Components
Arduino Board: Compatible with models like Arduino Uno, Nano, or Mega.

MPU6050 Sensor: A combined gyroscope and accelerometer used for detecting hand orientation and motion.

Flex Sensor: Measures finger bending to control the gripper.

Servo Motors (x4): Control the movements of the robotic arm.

Power Supply: Appropriate power source to drive the servos and sensors.

Breadboard and Jumper Wires: For setting up the prototype circuit.


Servo Motor Assignments:
Servo 1 (Pin 3): Controls forward/reverse movement.
Servo 2 (Pin 5): Controls up/down movement.
Servo 3 (Pin 6): Controls the gripper.
Servo 4 (Pin 9): Controls left/right movement.


Software Requirements
Arduino IDE: To upload the code to the Arduino board.

MPU6050 Library: Required for interfacing with the MPU6050 sensor.

Servo Library: Used for controlling the servo motors.


Circuit Diagram
The Circuit_diagram folder contains detailed diagrams to assist in the hardware setup. Each component is labeled for clarity, 
ensuring an accurate and efficient assembly process.

Setup and Installation
1. Connect the Hardware: Refer to the provided circuit diagram to connect the MPU6050, flex sensor, and servo motors to the Arduino board.

2. Load the Code: Open the Arduino IDE and load the sketch from the Code/ directory. Make sure you have the required libraries installed.

3. Upload the Sketch: Connect the Arduino to your computer and upload the sketch. Ensure the correct board and port are selected in the Arduino IDE.

4. Power Up the System: After uploading the code, power the system either through the computer USB or an external power supply, depending on your setup.

How It Works
Orientation Detection: The MPU6050 detects the hand's orientation along the X, Y, and Z axes. This data is processed to determine the corresponding movements of the robotic arm.

Gripper Control: The flex sensor's output determines the position of the gripper, whether it is open or closed.

Servo Control: The processed data is mapped to servo motor angles to control the arm's movements smoothly.


Customization and Expansion

Additional Sensors: You can add more sensors for finer control or additional functionalities.

Code Modifications: The code is modular and can be easily modified to adjust sensitivity, movement ranges, or add new features.

Different Hardware: The system can be adapted to work with different microcontrollers or sensor types, depending on the requirements.


Troubleshooting

Sensor Readings: If the MPU6050 or flex sensor readings seem incorrect, ensure the connections are secure and the sensors are properly powered.

Servo Motors: If the servos do not move correctly, check the power supply and the pin connections to the Arduino.

Code Errors: If there are issues with the code, ensure all necessary libraries are installed and the correct board is selected in the Arduino IDE.


Future Enhancements
Wireless Control: Implementing wireless communication (e.g., Bluetooth or Wi-Fi) to control the robotic arm remotely.

Improved Accuracy: Fine-tuning the sensor data processing for more accurate and smoother movements.

Voice Control: Adding a voice recognition module to control the robotic arm using voice commands.
